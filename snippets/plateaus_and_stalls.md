After a prolonged run of weight loss my body decided it didn't want to continue. Day after day the scale showed the same number. It was incredibly frustrating! This is called a plateau (or 'stall').

# remodeling

The first thing research showed me is that there might not be a problem, other than my expectations. My body might be _remodeling_, readjusting my fat stores after the rapid change. Common advice is to measure waist, belly, legs, and arms with a tape measure, to see that slimming is still happening even though my weight was staying the same.

Some ketoers report stalls lasting weeks and months before weight loss continues.

# What to do?

Waiting isn't my strong suit; I wanted to _do_ something!

> _...a lot of people will also plateau at a weight higher than they would like. At that point, we suggest that they do something to change the schedule. Sometimes we’ll suggest changing the diet, and other times we’ll suggest changing the fasting regimen. If you have plateaued, just do something different._

My first response was [intermittent fasting](intermittent_fasting.md), skipping breakfast (because I wasn't really hungry anyway). Later I pushed lunch back, making longer the amount of time my body had to consume my body fat.

My second attack was to eat at my maintence calorie level for a few days, and then go back to my original deficit. Still stalled.

My third idea is [longer-term fasting](fasting.md); check that page for details.

Wait for remodeling or try something different. There's no rock-solid consensus on what works to break a plateau.
