When buying a magnesium supplement to replenish electrolytes (especially in the keto diet) we're faced with the choice between

* magnesium citrate
* magnesium oxide

## bio-availability

In a study entitled _**Magnesium citrate found more bioavailable than other magnesium preparations in a randomised, double-blind study**_ we see:

"Magnesium oxide supplementation resulted in no differences compared to placebo."

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/14596323/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/14596323/)

This would seem to argue for buying the citrate variety and staying away from the oxide.

## bio-retention & dosage

Dr Jason Fong, MD, says _"Most magnesium (about 70%) taken orally is not absorbed but excreted unchanged in the feces."_

This makes figuring out dosage challenging; do you take enough tablets to wind up with the recommended magnesium amount before or after you throw out the 70%? I have no idea about this as of yet.
