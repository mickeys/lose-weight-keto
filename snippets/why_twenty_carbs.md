In **The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living** by Stephen Phinney, MD PhD, and Jeff Volek, Phd RD, they outline the reasons for the recommendation of 20g carbs/day; it's an amount that will lead even the worst candidates to ketosis:

> _At the other end of this spectrum might be a type-2 diabetic who, on a “balanced diet” providing 300 grams per day of carbohydrate, requires 2 shots of insulin plus two other oral drugs to keep fasting glucose values even marginally controlled under 150 mg/dl. For this person to achieve an optimum initial response that allows reduction (and hopefully withdrawal) of diabetic medications, clinical experience has shown that holding dietary carbohydrate at 20-to-25 grams per day is often necessary._

> _For many type-2 diabetics, a few weeks at this level allows them to reduce or stop both insulin and oral medication while at the same time achieving better overall glucose control. A few months later, following substantial weight loss, some individuals might be able to increase daily carbohydrate intake above 50 grams per day and still maintain excellent glucose control, whereas others might need to remain below the 50 gram level to keep their type-2 diabetes in complete remission._

> _In either case, whether it is being able to lose weight and keep it off, or putting a frank case of type-2 diabetes into remission, how much you choose to limit your dietary carbohydrate intake should be driven by your personal experience. As a result, the amount of carbohydrate that you decide to eat might vary considerably depending on your individual metabolic condition and the level of benefit you wish to derive._
