Intermittent fasting (IF) is the practice of skipping a meal (or two) to increase the amount of time that your body is getting energy from your body fat.

Since hunger-supression is a common side-effect of keto, you may find yourself waking up and not being hungry for breakfast. It then becomes natural to lunch to eat. If you eat between noon and 8pm, you're not eating for 16 hours and eating for 8, which is abbreviated to 16:8.

Many days I wasn't even hungry at lunch, and wound up eating at 2pm, for 18:6.

Other days I didn't feel a need to eat until 4pm, for 20:4. I'd eat a small meal at the beginning of that 4-hour window and another before the end.

Occasionally keto completely blocked my feelings of needing to eat; 23:1. Those days I'd eat all of my calories in one meal, referred to as OMAD (One Meal A Day).

I wasn't dogmatic about which IF timing I was following, choosing to eat when I was hungry. Every day was different.

> _Imagine you and your twin are going to eat 1200 calories._

> _You spread it out during the day, so every hour you eat another 50 calories. What happens for you is every hour you give your insulin a nudge … new food coming in … need some insulin to use it, and that turns off access to body fat. Normally a few hours after eating a meal your insulin drops … but you are eating every hour. So you never access body fat … the total energy in your circulation for the day was 1200 … so now your body has to budget for that and furlough multiple optional processes, it’s going to be a pretty awful day for you. Your are likely to feel lethargic and hungry all day._

> _What happened to your twin is he also ate 1200 calories but did it all in one meal. He also nudged his insulin, probably more than you did, but a few hours after eating it’s low again and now he is able to use body fat for energy. He might get an additional 1200 calories from body fat for the day. Not only is he going to weigh less on the scale, he’s going to have had an awesome day with a budget of 2400 calories of energy._
