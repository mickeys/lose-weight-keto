This my narrative of how I lost 50 pounds on [keto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet). I did this, quickly, without _needing_ to buy any special food prep devices, magic powders, strange foods, or -- and this might be the best of all -- exercise. I'll be as brief as possible, with some explanation below, and some inline links to resources I've found useful.

## How Do I Get Thin?

There are exactly two steps necessary to get thin.

1. **<font color="red">Get into the right frame of mind.</font>** The weight loss phase is a **limited period of time** during which you'll eat a limited variety of food. No cheat days during this loss phase. Deal with it! You can do it! Cheat later.

2. **<font color="red">Weigh, log, and eat</font>** (in that order) only foods that consume your body fat for energy.

Details on how to do this are only a few paragraphs below; hang on.

## How Did I Get Fat?

By eating only foods that tell your body to store what you eat as fat, and eating a quantity that powers your body (and no more).

### Everything I Knew About Dieting Is Wrong!

<img src="./i/globe_and_mail_ads.png" hspace="5" align="left">
Almost all foods touted as "healthy" are very much just the opposite, causing you to add to your body fat -- very disheartening.

My German grandmother repeatedly said "meat makes meat" (eating meat makes one fat); she and my mother was all about whole wheat bread, vegetables, rice, and pasta. Each morning in the old country the kids were each fed a tablespoon of glucose and another of fructose; a practice deemed essential to children's health.

It's terrifying how wrong their food choices were; I spent at least two decades of my life being haunted by the joys of eating.

The irony is that low-carb high-fat (LCFH) diets were anecdotally known to doctors between the 1820s and 1950s. The scientific examination began with Dr. William Harvey and his obese patient, William Banting, in 1862. His prescription was no starch and sugar, no beer or potatoes; only meat, fish, vegetables, and wine. His healthy eating book, _Letter on Corpulence_, was published a year later. 

When I travelled to Scotland I was surprised that Dr. Atkins is pretty unknown; LCHF eating is known as "Banting".

Look at the population around you; we're [fatter than we've ever been](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity), to the point of using up a major part of our national wealth on medical care for the fat: from juvenile diabetes to all the dire consequences of adult obesity.

Delve into the scientific literature if you want, or watch the best documentary that I've found thus far, [The Perfect Human Diet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014248/) (2012). Or read a <a href="http://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/how-the-keto-diet-with-no-exercise-outperforms-the-standard-american-diet-with-exercise">good article for layman</a>.

You'll have to let go of **all** the folk wisdom family and friends have been broadcasting to you as truth since you were a baby. It's all wrong. We now have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945587/">nutritional science</a>, we **know** what our bodies need to not be pudgy.

## How Do I Get Thin, In Detail

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/south-african-tourism/6252672423"><img src="./i/bushman_northern_cape_africa.jpg" width="50%" border="1" hspace="5" align="right"></a>
Evolutionarily speaking, you're a bushman with a smartphone. Your body is optimized to efficiently live from stored fat. Over at least the last 100,000 years your [engine expects a diet](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170607133246.htm) of mostly meat, some foraged veggies, and very intermittent delicious treats of berries, honey, etc. Mostly fat and protein.

When sweet treats (sugars) are eaten a metabolic toggle is flipped so we get energy from the delights and STORE THE EXTRA AS BODY FAT; who knows when the tribe will next encounter such wonderful things?

Complely unknown in the African bush were high-carbohydrate "healthy" foods (which are turned into sugars). No bread, pasta, power bars, bowls of fruit salad, and especially no refined sugar or high-fructose corn syrup (which is everywhere in our Standard American Diet (SAD)).

Of course we're fat! We're eating the wrong fuel and storing the energy as body fat.<br clear="right">

### How To Start Losing Weight With Keto

#### Take 'Before' Pictures

If you're reading this, interested in weight loss, you may not be thrilled with your body right now.

<img src="./i/20100704_mickey_by_espressobuzz-cropped.jpg" border="1" align="left" hspace="5"><img src="./i/my_keto_weight_loss_curve.png" border="1" align="left" hspace="5"><img src="./i/20180113_186_2.jpg" border="1" align="right" hspace="5">Trust me, take 'before' pictures; they'll be an reward a few months down the road.

I didn't and I regret it; I was sporting quite the paunch. I was not happy with the mirror. The closest that I have are the photos you see here.

Your progress will be different than mine. Many factors influence weight loss, including those you have no control over - gender and genetics - and those you do - daily calorie deficit, macronutrients eaten, and cheat days (which you won't have).
<br clear="left">

#### Figure Out Your Ideal Weight

It's good to know what modern medicine thinks is your <a href="https://www.calculator.net/ideal-weight-calculator.html">ideal weight</a>. It may not be _your_ target, but it's _a_ target. Aim at whatever weight you desire, but get an outside unbiased opinion.

#### Calculate Your Macronutrient Requirements (macros)

Eating healthfully on keto requires that you know your daily requirements for the important micronutriets -- protein, fat, and carbohydrates. This [keto macro calculator](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) will output something like

```
54/M/6'0" | CW 187.4 | 21% BF | Mostly sedentary

* 1429 kcal Goal, a 25% deficit. (812 min, 1905 max)
* 10g Carbohydrates
* 119g Protein (89g min, 148g max)
* 101g Fat (33g min, 154g max)
```

`Sedentary` refers to my lack of exercise in the weight-loss phase. The only life variable I'm changing these months is what I eat. How I can judge the efficacy of keto if I also jumped onto a power-lifting regimen, morning runs, cold shower therapy, etc.? 

Your body constantly burns energy, even when fast asleep. The calories in the food you eat must be less than your body uses, so your body fat is used to provide the difference. `Deficit` is that difference.

All successful weight-loss plans must must have this deficit, shortened to "CICO" (calories in < calories out). Also, the _kind_ of calories you eat determine your hormonal response to food, which determines whether your body will store or release fat.


 In the 1950s, two researchers-Professor Alan Kekwick and Dr. Gaston L.S. Pawan - jointly conducted a study to test the theory that differing proportions of carbs, fat and protein might have different effects on weight loss, even if the calories were kept the same.

They put obese subjects on a 1,000-calorie diet but varied the percentages of protein, carbs and fats. Some subjects were on 90 percent protein, some were on 90 percent fat, and some were on 90 percent carbs. The subjects on the 90 percent protein diet lost .6 pounds per day; the ones on the 90 percent fat diet lost .9 pounds per day and the ones on 90 percent carbs actually gained a bit. 



Back to macros: the above example shows that I have a daily calorie budget of 1429, which is me 

#### Know The Quantities You're Eating

<img src="./i/taylor_s-l1000_digital_food_scale-sm.jpg" align="right" hspace="5">The only way to be sure you're (1) eating less than your calorie target (2) getting your macronutrients (macros) is to know the quantities. In the beginning I would, for example, use only known amounts; the weight on the steak package, or the number of eggs. You can make this work, but it's difficlt. Quickly I bought a set of measuring spoons, a 2-cup measure, and a food scale. Optional, but makes losing weight much more assured.<br clear="right">

#### Pick A Mobile App

To succeed you'll need to weight and log everything that passes your lips **before** its consumed: suprises abound in foods. Look for a tracker with both a website and smartphone app; consider <a href="http://loseit.com/">LoseIt!</a> or <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">MyFtnessPal</a>.

#### Empty Your Fridge Of High-Carb Foods

I can't stress this enough. If I had "bad" foods within reach I was certain to eat it. Give away <u>everything</u> that will sabotage your weight loss; be ruthless. If you're sharing living space carve out a cabinet as yours; label it "Keep Out - Keto Only".

#### Stock Your Fridge With Low-Carb Foods

<img src="./i/nutrition_label.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Read the labels!

During the weight-loss phase buy nothing that shows more than a carb; they sneakily add up.

Hide lower-fat and fat-free options; because (1) fat is your body's preferred fuel and (2) food makers must replace the fat with things that don't belong inside you, like guar gum.

Be mindful of calorie count.

#### Weigh And Log All Foods BEFORE you cook / eat them

#### Exercise? Forget About It!

#### Get Support From The Community

* [Keto for Normies](http://ketoconnect.libsyn.com/website)

#### You Already Have A Six-Pack!

A bit of encourage  ment before we actually start. You already have a six-pack, which you've cleverly hidden under fat. You burn away the fat to uncover your muscular glory.

#### Keto Flu, Keto Rage

### Things I Eat

#### Salami & Eggs

#### Tunafish, Mayo, and Pickles

#### Hamburger, Onion Rings, Mayo, Cheese

### If you're tired of starting over, don't give up!

Cheat days? Sabotage meals? None during your limited weight-loss phase. You'll figure it out when you're in maintenance phase.

Whilst on the topic of self-sabotage: alcohol. Due to your body's _oxidative priority_, the order in which foods are used for fuel, alcohols are always at the front of the line, so much of the food eaten at the same time is stored as fat. That, along with the high carb content of many beers & liquors, is a double whammy.

## How Does Keto Work?

Here's a tiny bit of detail into how keto works.

### Calories In, Calories Out (CICO)

### Tell Your Body To Get Energy From Your Fat

## How Do I Maintain My Goal Weight?

I don't yet know. I hit my goal weight a few years ago but then stopped being mindful (and regained 2/3 of what I'd lost). When I next hit my goal weight, in about six weeks, I'll start to experiment with what I've read about weight maintenance, write about it, and post it here.
